> Innovative hardware and software technologies for musical expression

## About Us

Muse Kinetics, formerly Keith McMillen Instruments, develops innovative hardware and software technologies that allow musicians to interface with computers in exciting new ways. Based in Berkeley, California, we provide today's musician with the tools needed to bring new dimensions of expression and control to their performance.

We believe when a computer is played as a musical instrument it should feel and respond like one, with all the nuance and sensitivity that makes an instrument musical.
